# CodSoft-Internship-C++

This repository contains three C++ projects: Library Management System, Number Guessing Game, and Simple Calculator. Each of these projects is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in C++ programming, such as user input handling, control structures, file handling, and simple data management. Below is a brief overview of each project.

1. Library Management System: 
The Library Management System is a console-based application aimed at managing a library's book inventory. Users can add new books, view existing books, search for books by title or author, issue and return books, and even delete books from the system. The system keeps track of each book's title, author, and availability, and allows users to perform different actions like adding books, issuing, or returning them. This project demonstrates file handling and simple data management in C++.

2. Number Guessing Game:
The Number Guessing Game is a fun console-based game in which the computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, helping the player get closer to the correct answer. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, and it also tracks how many attempts it takes to guess the number. This project demonstrates the use of random number generation, loops, and basic input/output operations.

3. Simple Calculator:
4. The Simple Calculator is a basic calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator, then calculates and displays the result. It handles basic input validation to ensure the user provides correct values, especially when performing division to avoid dividing by zero. This project demonstrates how to work with arithmetic operations, basic input validation, and user interaction in C++.
